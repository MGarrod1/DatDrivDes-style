# DatDrivDes-style


A small script for plotting networks in a style similar to that of the cover of the 2nd Edition of Andy Kirkâ€™s Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design (Sage, 2016).

The colour palette was extracted manually from an image of the cover using: [https://imagecolorpicker.com/en](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en). 

# Requirements

The plots were created using Python 3.7 on an Anaconda distribution (conda version : 4.7.12). The packages present in my environment at the time are listed in environment.yml.
