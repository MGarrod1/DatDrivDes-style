# DatDrivDes-style

![](https://github.com/MGarrod1/DatDrivDes-style/blob/main/Example_ER.png)

A small script for plotting networks in a style similar to that of the cover of the 2nd Edition of Andy Kirkâ€™s [Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design (Sage, 2016)](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/data-visualisation/book266150).

The colour palette was extracted manually from an image of the cover using: [https://imagecolorpicker.com/en](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en). 

## Example: Karate club

Example below using [Zachary's karate club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) social network (available in networkx).

# Requirements

The plots were created using Python 3.7 on an Anaconda distribution (conda version : 4.7.12). The packages present in my environment at the time are listed in environment.yml.

# To dos

- Automatically extract the colour palette from the book cover image.
- The real cover contains some nodes arranged close to the others. Find a way to add these in properly.
